# Specification

## 4.6.1.1 Relationship between hardware and software
The computer is made up of two parts: hardware and software.

Hardware is something that can be picked up/touched.
Software is the executable data and applications which tell your hardware what to do.
Without both, a computer system is useless.

They have an interdependant relationship - they need each other for them to be useful.
