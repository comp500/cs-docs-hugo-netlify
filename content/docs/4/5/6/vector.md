# Specification

## 4.5.6.5 Vector graphics
Uses geometrical primitives such as points, lines, curves and polygons, based on mathematical equations, to create images. These geometrical primitives are stored in lists, which allow the computer to reproduce the image.

Bézier curves are used to store and reproduce curves in vector graphics. This allows lines to be curved using handles to manipulate them. You can use this to draw a circle with just 4 points, connected by bézier curves.

One common format for vector graphics is the SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format. This is based on XML, and stores lists of objects with the properties of those objects as attributes.
