# Specification

## 4.5.4.1 Unsigned Binary
Unsigned binary is binary that does not have a **sign bit**, therefore it cannot represent a negative number. Unsigned binary numbers are also integers, so they can be easily understood by humans.

Due to this format not using the sign bit, the total number of numbers this format can represent is \`2^n\`, where n is the number of bits used. As *0* counts as one of these numbers, the actual maximum is \`2^n -1\`. The minimum is 0, as there are no negative numbers.

### Conversion between Binary and Denary
Denary 19 is equal to 00010011 in binary, as follows:

|\`2^7\`|\`2^6\`|\`2^5\`|\`2^4\`|\`2^3\`|\`2^2\`|\`2^1\`|\`2^0\`|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|1|

Binary 01100100 is equal to 100 in denary, as follows:

|\`2^7\`|\`2^6\`|\`2^5\`|\`2^4\`|\`2^3\`|\`2^2\`|\`2^1\`|\`2^0\`|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
|0|1|1|0|0|1|0|0|

\`64 + 32 + 4 = 100\`


## 4.5.4.2 Unsigned Binary arithmetic
Addition and subtraction of unsigned binary is documented in the [Logic Gates](/docs/4/6/logic-gates/) page.

## 4.5.4.3 Signed binary using twoâ€™s complement
Integers that can be positive or negative can be represented in binary as signed numbers. Using 8 bits, the following can be shown:
\`
{:
(0\ 0001001 = 9),
(1\ 1110110 = -10),
(1\ 1110111 = -9)
:}
\`

The first bit denotes the sign of the number, and the rest of the bits denote the magnitude of the number, in this case 9. Negative numbers are represented using two's complement, where the digits are inverted, and 1 is added.

## 4.5.4.4 Numbers with a fractional part
This point of the specification has not been covered yet.

## 4.5.4.5 Rounding errors
This point of the specification has not been covered yet.

## 4.5.4.6 Absolute and relative errors
This point of the specification has not been covered yet.

## 4.5.4.7 Range and precision
This point of the specification has not been covered yet.

## 4.5.4.8 Normalisation of floating point form
This point of the specification has not been covered yet.

## 4.5.4.9 Underflow and overflow
Overflow errors happen when there are not enough bits in the register or memory to store a value. This is due to the maximum value a register can hold being exceeded, so there are not enough bits to store them. When this happens, data is lost, causing problems for many applications.
